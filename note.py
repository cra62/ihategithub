#Notes

#Architecture is typically split into three sections; Front end, control, database or design, control and model

#Repositories
#Repositories used as a database for projects. 
#Allow for editing, creating and updating projects. 
#Helps prevent conflicts of differing code.

#Version control
#Shows most current and past versions of a project.

#Workflow
#Bug, enhancement from client or requirement change is usually the start
#Uses a story to report or record problem
#Uses story to program a solution 
#Must be tested and reviewed before delivery 

#Version Control pt2
#Multiple people can be working on a project at once
#If code is the same as from when first pulled, then there is no merge conflict
#If the code is different, the version must be updated and any merge conflicts must be solved before pushing new code to the repository
